    "Today, we are going to demonstrate the use of Cantera to calculate adiabatic flame temperatures for a range of fuels and conditions, and compare several methods in Cantera to how one would do it without Cantera.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adiabatic Flame Temperatures\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bit of background, the adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature achieved when a given fuel-oxidizer combination is combustion in a perfectly insulated reactor. If no heat is lost to the surroundings and the reaction occurs at constant pressure, conservation of energy dictates that the reaction proceeds at constant enthalpy.  Namely, the enthalpy at the end of combustion (_state 2_) must equal that at the beginning (_state 1_):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h_{\\rm mix, 2} = h_{\\rm mix, 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Wehn we consider the enthalpy of the mixture, there are two components to consider: the enthalpy of formation $\\Delta^\\circ_{\\rm f}h$ and the sensible enthalpy $h_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this more concrete, let's pick a specific reaction: stoichiometric combustion of methane, CH$_4$ with air::\n",
    "$${\\rm CH_4 + 2\\left(O_2 + 3.76\\,N_2\\right) \\leftrightharpoons 2\\,H_2O + CO_2 + 7.52\\,N_2 }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From the reaction stoichiometry (note that the net stoichiometric coefficient for N$_2$ is zero), the heat of combustion released by this reaction is:\n",
    "$$ q_{\\rm rxn} = -\\sum_k \\nu_k \\Delta^\\circ_{{\\rm f}}h_k = \\Delta^\\circ_{\\rm f}h_{\\rm CH_4} + 2\\Delta^\\circ_{\\rm f}h_{\\rm O_2} - \\Delta^\\circ_{\\rm f}h_{\\rm CO_2}-2 \\Delta^\\circ_{\\rm f}h_{\\rm H_2O}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the reaction must occur at constant enthalpy, the heat released must be stored in the products. In essence, the heat is used to heat the products to a final temperature:\n",
    "$$q_{\\rm heating} = \\sum_k\\nu_{{\\rm prod},k}\\left[h_k(T_2) - h_k(T_1)\\right] = h_{\\rm CO_2}(T_2) - h_{\\rm CO_2}(T_1) + 2\\left[h_{\\rm H_2O}(T_2) - h_{\\rm H_2O}(T_1)\\right] + 7.52\\left[h_{\\rm N_2}(T_2) - h_{\\rm N_2}(T_1)\\right] $$\n",
    "where, again, states 1 and 2 represent the final and initial states, respectively.  $\\nu_{\\rm prod}$ is the reverse stoichiometric coefficient (i.e. that for all product species). Note that this assumes complete combution - there are no reactant species left to heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a purely adiabatic reaction, we will have $q_{\\rm rxn} = q_{\\rm heating}$, and hence:\n",
    "$$\\sum_k\\nu_{{\\rm prod},k}\\left[h_k(T_2) - h_k(T_1)\\right] + \\sum_k \\nu_k \\Delta^\\circ_{{\\rm f}}h_k = 0$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that only a few variables are dependent on the final temperature $T_2$.  We might be tempted to write the above equation in terms of those variables, but let's hold off for now. Our next step really depends on what method we use to solve the problem. In short, we need a means of calculating the enthalpy values, so that we may determine which value of $T_2$ satisfies our adiabatic condition.  \n",

    "## Approach 1 - Complete combustion, calculating \"by hand\" and using tabulated data.\n",

For the curious, a collection of these tables are stored in the `data` folder that accompanies this notebook.\n",
